# Visualizations

This trophy shows you some Scapy visualization tools.

## Tasks

**task #1**

- create the packet of you choice
- use `str` and `hexdump` to show the build packet values
- call `show` and `show2` on the packet and notice the differences
- call `pdfdump` or `canvas_dump`

**task #2**

- use `srloop` to send 100 packets to `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`
- call `multiplot` on the resulting packets list and plot IP id

**task #3**

- use the `traceroute` function to get the patch to two different targets
- try `world_trace` and `trace3D`
